<h1>Summary of What I Learned</p>
<p>In Foundtain recipes I have learned about more functions that can be applied in the terminal/CLI. Additionally I have learned about HTML boilerplate and the different elements.</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>In Git Hub, I learned the following:</p>
<ol>Repositories</ol>
    <li>Creating a repository through Github and adding it to the local machine.</li>
    <li>Reviewing changes made to code. For example: "Git Status"</li>
    <li>Opening code directly into VSCode by using the shortcut: "code ."</li>
    <li>Adding changes to the stage/quue by using : "Git Add"</li>
    <li>Commiting changes by using "git commit -m" and using conventional commit templates. This helps others understand what changes occured in the code.</li>
<p>For the HTML section, I learned about the boiler plate and the following elements:</p>
<ul>HTML</ul>
    <li>To get the boilerplate template shortcut in VS Code, ensure the file extension is .html first. Afterward, once you have CD'd into the correct directory and opened the .html file using "code .", in VS Code enter "!" then select "Enter" on the keyboard to pre-populate the template.</li>
    <li>Elements such as:
    <ul> 
        <li>paragraphs "p"</li> 
        <li>strong "strong"</li> 
        <li>emphasis "em"</li> 
        <li>bold "b"</li>
        <li>italicized "i"</li>
        <li>notes "<!- -"</li> 
        <li>lists</li>
        <li>anchors "a"</li>
    </li>
    </ul>
